# ProGroups

ProGroups allows you to organize objects in your scene into “selection sets”, **without modifying the objects or hierarchy**. Then, use the interface to **hide, freeze, and select** entire groups at once. 

These powerful features allows you to work with even the most complex scenes with ease.
