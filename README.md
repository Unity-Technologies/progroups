# ProGroups

ProGroups allows you to organize objects in your scene into “selection sets”, **without modifying the objects or hierarchy**. Then, use the interface to **hide, freeze, and select** entire groups at once. 

These features help keep your large, complex scenes nicely organized and easy to work with.
